#  README

This repository is a forked from Simu5G(https://github.com/Unipisa/Simu5G.git) project.
We add a scenario featuring Connected vehicles and MEC. We implemented a parametric "vehiclar" service aiming to mimic the behaviour of real world "application".
This service is composed by a UEApplication and a MECApplication as shown in our model: 



The parameters of this service can be change in order to adapt to experimenteur needs. Tunable parameters are the following:  

- Uplink
  - payload size --> The size of the payload at the applicaiton level
       - Can be modified href="http://github.com/user/project/blob/master/Readme.md#my-anchor">here</a>

  - Inter sending time 
- Downlink
  - payload size --> The size of the payload at the applicaiton level
  - Inter sending time(for synchronous model) or always answering (for asynchronous model)
- Processing: Millions Instructions associated to each received request 
- Dissemination radius for cooperative applicaitons. This type of applicaiton correspond to applicaiton nÂ°1 as shown in the following figure, where the edge process sensed data and retrieve them to a certain area arround the vehicle that is performing a cooperative service.
