#  README

This repository is a forked from Simu5G(https://github.com/Unipisa/Simu5G.git) project.
We add a scenario featuring Connected vehicles and MEC. We implemented a parametric "vehiclar" service aiming to mimic the behaviour of real world "application".
This service is composed by a UEApplication and a MECApplication as shown in our model: 



The parameters of this service can be change in order to adapt to experimenteur needs. Tunable parameters are the following:  

- Uplink
  - payload size --> The size of the payload at the applicaiton level
       - Can be modified in the ini file 
        https://github.com/zazim13/Simu5G-MecBasedAV/blob/5284bb357f1e9413ce2399cb2ba85387022a1069/simulations/NR/mec/vehicularMec/omnetpp.ini#L268
         
       - The code corresponding can be found here:

  - Inter sending time
        
       - Can be modified in the ini file with the following parameter
         https://github.com/zazim13/Simu5G-MecBasedAV/blob/ebe81de55d23403e72c62e5251d1054ef4bd9da8/simulations/NR/mec/vehicularMec/omnetpp.ini#L268

- Downlink
  - The payload size at the application level to send to the sending car:

  - The payload size at the application level to send to neighboring cars: 
    https://github.com/zazim13/Simu5G-MecBasedAV/blob/ebe81de55d23403e72c62e5251d1054ef4bd9da8/src/apps/PingPong/MECPingPongApp.cc#L628

    
- Processing: Millions Instructions associated to each received request
  https://github.com/zazim13/Simu5G-MecBasedAV/blob/ebe81de55d23403e72c62e5251d1054ef4bd9da8/src/apps/PingPong/MECPingPongApp.cc#L108
  
- Dissemination radius for cooperative applications. This type of application corresponds to application nÂ°1, as shown in the following figure, where the edge process senses data and answers to a certain area around the vehicle that is performing cooperative service.
